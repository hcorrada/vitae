  title: "CMSC 858P - Computational Methods for High-Throughput Analysis of Biological Systems"
  description: |
    Developed this new advanced graduate-level course concentrating on the use of Statistical Learning methods and 
    algorithms in the analysis of large high-throughput biomedical assays. First offering attracted 21 students, including 
    students from ECE, AMSC and BISI. This course was merged with other content to become CMSC 702 (Computational Systems
    Biology) to be offered as a regular course in the CS department starting in Spring 2012.
